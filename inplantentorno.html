    My name is Silvia and this is my portfolio: a multidisciplinary mix of graphic design,
    code and motion. If I have to define myself by the things I have studied I am an environmentalist,
    a graphic designer and I am currently learning p5js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.

        <p class="displayed"> inplant is a brand that shows the quality of the air we breathe.
        Its aim is to raise awareness about the poor quality of the air that surrounds us, especially indoors, and 
        offers a renting of air purifying plants. This brand has been created for the
        final master's project, carried out with Jonathan Rodríguez, during the Master in
        Graphic Design 19/20 by ELISAVA. The aim of the project is to create and design the identity of a brand
        that offers a solution to improve people's quality of life. </p>
